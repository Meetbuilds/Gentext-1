4)Trending Global/Indian Topics
One short sized tweet about what’s trending globally (without losing your personality as indian or asian) OR
one longer opinion tweet on a trending topic — alternating between India and global events. Keep the balance so you don’t seem overly domestic or overly foreign in perspective. (you can add new ideas)
Examples:
-Dependency of US economy on Indians and Indian based americans
-Stating what is trump being doing since his epstein files controversy 
-All updates about russia-ukraine war 
etc

5)Remaining tweets – Blend personal reflections, AI/ML/future tech opinions, fitness/nutrition tips, Indian classical music appreciation, Indian foreign policy observations/ insights, 
occasional witty observations etc. (you can add new ideas)

any other thing that you can think of.
